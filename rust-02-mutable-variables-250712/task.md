# Day 2: Variables and Mutability

- **Topic:** Declaring variables with `let` and making them mutable with `let mut`.
- **Exercise:** Create a program that declares an immutable variable `x` with a value of 5. Print it. Then try to assign a new value to `x` and observe the compiler error. Change `let` to `let mut` to make it work.
- **Hint:** The compiler error message will tell you exactly what you need to do!
