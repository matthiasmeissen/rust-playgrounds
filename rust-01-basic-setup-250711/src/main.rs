// Basics
// Use cargo new <filename> to create a new program
// Use cargo build to just build the program
// Use cargo run, to build an run the program

// The line fn main() {} defines a function called main
// This is the first one that gets executed when to program runs
// The ! after a function name means it calls a macro instead of a normal function


fn main() {
    println!("Hello Rust.");
}
